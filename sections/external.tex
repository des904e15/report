\section{External powers attacking the consumer}
In \cref{applianceCompanyTree} some more distant powers were mentioned - states, terrorist organisations, environmental activists and blackmailers.
Abusing the smart meter of the consumer for these distant powers is a small piece in a bigger picture.

They all want to shut down the power of the consumer in order to achieve a bigger objective, power, political influence or money.
The posibilities enabled by an off-switch were discussed in \cref{off_switch}.
The attack tree depicting this attack can be seen on \cref{fig:attack_trees:external}.
