\section{External Consumption Meter}\label{ecm}
An External Consumption Meter(ECM) is an electric meter which is attached to the incoming electricity phase(s) in the panel.
It consists of an measuring unit and a device to distribute these measuring, called an energy monitor.
The measuring unit is attached to the phase(s) and outputs raw measuring to the energy monitor.

The energy monitor can analyse the data and distribute them, this depends on which solution one chooses.
Some ECMs have a energy monitor which distribute the consumption data outside the home network and some also have the ability to analyse the consumption data.\cite{TED}\cite{efergy}\cite{open_energy_monitor}
