\section{Bell Lapadula}

Bell and LaPadula have devised a mathematical model that targets military and governmental computer systems.
The model formalizes users accessing objects and how to handle this in a secure way so a confidential file cannot be leaked to a lower classification level.
The following is based on \citet{lapadula1996secure}.

\subsection{Access attributes}

\subsection{Requests and decisions}
