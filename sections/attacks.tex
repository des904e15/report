\subsubsection{Replay attacks}
This description of replay attacks is based on \citet[p.~223]{cryptoenginering}.

Eve can perform a replay attack if she is able to record a message from the communication between Alice and Bob.
She can then send the message to Bob at a later point in time. 

A related concept is retries.
During the run of a protocol Alice does not receive a response from Bob.
This could be because Bob did not receive Alice's request or a similar network problem.
To solve this Alice sends her message again.
This message is known as a retry.

Now Bob can receive both a replay from Eve and a retry from Alice.
Bob needs to deal with this properly so Eve cannot abuse replays to her advantage.
Abusing replays is known as a replay attack.
