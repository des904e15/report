As a method of identifying security problems within smart meter systems, we have constructed attack trees for each of the attacks that involves the smart meter.
First, we introduce the concept of attack trees and how we will base these on the context model defined in \cref{sec:smartmetercontext}.
Then we will, one by one, present the identified attacks and the overall ideas behind these attacks.
A more technical description of the individual attacks will be presented in \cref{attack_techniques}.
