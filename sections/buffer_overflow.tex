The following is based on \citet[p. 18]{foster2005buffer} and \citet[Section 1.1]{ruwase2004practical}.

A buffer overflow is an attack on a vulnerable program which modifies its memory state.
A vulnerable program is a program that does not check if a given input exceeds its buffer size in memory.
If the program gets some input which exceeds its memory buffer size the program will copy the rest of the input in some adjacent buffer.
This gives the attacker the opportunity to control the machine where the program is executed with the same rights as the program(for instance as ``root'').
