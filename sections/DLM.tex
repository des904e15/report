\newcommand{\value}{value}
\newcommand{\values}{values}

\paragraph{Acts for relation}
The acts for relation, $\rightarrow$, can be used to model groups and roles.
To model two \principals, Amy and Bob, to act for a group of programmers: $Amy \rightarrow programmers$ and $Bob \rightarrow programmers$.
Or if Amy has different roles: $Amy \rightarrow Amy\_programmer$ and $Amy \rightarrow Amy\_admin$.

\paragraph{Value}
A \value is a piece of data in a program, for instance an integer.

\paragraph{Privacy policy}
A privacy policy is represented as an owner of some \value and a set of readers.
The syntax is: <owner>: <readers>.
The owner is the \principal who owns the \value that was used for constructing the \value.
The readers are the \principals allowed by the owner.
The owner is implicitly allowed to read his own data.


\paragraph{Labels}
A \value is associated with a label and is a set of privacy policies.
When this \value flows through the system, all the policies need to be obeyed.
