This approach has been done by \citet{NILM}.
They use prior knowledge about appliances in the household to find the signatures of appliances in the power trace.
They then use these power signatures to dis-aggregate the power trace into appliances.
They also tested this approach as a live example in the real world, at six households in the United Kingdom.
