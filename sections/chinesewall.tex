\section{The Chinese Wall Security Policy}

The first security models that emerged were mainly concerned with military, and were thus tailored to fit the needs of the military. 
In \cite{brewer1989chinese} a model that is relevant for commercial applications is presented.
This model fits the needs of corporate business services like an analyst that must uphold the confidentiality of his clients, meaning that he cannot advise a corporation if he has insider knowledge of a competitor. \cite{brewer1989chinese}
