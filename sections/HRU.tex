\section{Protection in Operating Systems}
As most protection systems have different approaches to how they manage right and chains of trust they are hard to compare on equal terms.
Additionally it is often not easy to express which rights are leaked under certain conditions, or to whom they are leaked.
Oftentimes such leaks are only described informally by examining key features of a given system.

The model described in \cite{HRU} can be used to solve these problems.
By formally describing protection systems using a unified model, they can be compared in terms of the rights that they leak.
Using this approach two possible solutions (protection systems) to a problem can be compared on even terms.

In the following the model proposed by \cite{HRU} is presented.

\subsection{A Protection System}
A protection system can be described in terms of a set of rights $R$ and a set of commands $C$.
Note that both these sets are finite and static for a given system.
Because of this a system cannot dynamically add or remove rights or commands, under this model.
Dynamic creation and removal of commands can however be simulated.
\mikkel{The last part about dynamics is not part of the original article, should we expand on it?}

The state, or configuration, of a protection system is a triple $Q = (S, O, P)$, where $S$ is the set of subjects in the configuration, $O$ is the set of objects in the configuration and $P$ is an access matrix describing the rights each subject has to each object.
Thus $P[s, o]$ represents the cell in $P$ containing the set of rights that the subject $s$ has to the object $o$.
If no such rights exists we have that $P[s,o] = \emptyset$.

Defining a configuration system is the task of defining $R$ and $C$.
Rights have no inherent semantics except for those implied by their use in commands.
A command is defined as in \cref{protection:command}.
